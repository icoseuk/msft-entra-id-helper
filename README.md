## Deployment

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
1. Run the Docker container using the following command:

```dockerfile
docker run -d -p 80:8888 ghcr.io/icoseuk/msft-entra-id-helper:latest
```

In the above command:

- `-p 80:8888` maps port `8888` of the container to port `80` on the host machine, making the application accessible at `http://localhost/generate-access-token`. You can modify the host port as needed as long as it does not conflict with other services running on the host machine.

3. The application should now be running and accessible at http://localhost/.
